# TokenEater Native Overhaul — Design Spec

Date: 2026-07-13
Status: approved by owner (fork intent, cut list, design language, spend design)

## Context

This repo is a personal fork of AThevon/TokenEater (v5.8.0), free to diverge from
upstream. The owner runs the app on two machines: a personal Mac (Claude Pro/Max
account) and a work Mac (Claude Enterprise account). Three problems drive this
overhaul:

1. **Enterprise mislabel.** Enterprise usage arrives via the API's `extra_usage`
   object, and the app labels it "Extra Credits" with a bare percentage. For an
   enterprise account that label is wrong, and the dollar figures the API provides
   (`used_credits`, `monthly_limit` in minor units + `currency`) are shown only on
   one dashboard tile — never in the menu bar, popover, or anywhere prominent.
2. **Visual identity sprawl.** Three design systems coexist (window `DS` tokens,
   theme-engine-colored popover/menu bar/overlay, separate widget tokens). The
   target look is the RaiDrive project's native macOS restraint.
3. **Unused surface area.** Widgets, the Agent Watchers overlay, the theme engine,
   the in-app updater/brew pipeline, legacy migrations, and French localization are
   unused by the owner.

## Goals

- One native macOS design language across every surface.
- Correct, plan-aware labeling of usage-based spend, with dollar amounts primary.
- Same binary adapts to personal (Pro/Max) and work (Enterprise) accounts with no
  mode switch — everything derives from the API response.
- A raw API response viewer so unknown account shapes can be inspected in-app.
- Substantially smaller codebase: delete unused features and legacy code.

## Non-goals

- No upstream compatibility; no PRs back to the original repo.
- No rename: app name, bundle IDs (`com.tokeneater.app`), and shared-cache paths
  stay, because renaming breaks Keychain ACL trust and signing. Cosmetic rename may
  happen later.
- No new metrics beyond what the two existing endpoints return.

## 1. The cut

Deleted outright (code, tests, project targets, docs references, CI steps):

| Area | Items |
|---|---|
| Widgets | `TokenEaterWidget/` target, widget entitlements, `NSExtension` plutil hack in workflows/docs, widget nuke instructions, `WidgetReloader` helper |
| Overlay / Agent Watchers | `OverlayWindowController`, `OverlayView`, `AgentWatchersSectionView`, `SessionMonitorService`, `SessionStore`, `OverlayHitTest`, `OverlayTriggerZone`, `WatcherStyle`, `WatcherVisibility`, `WatcherScanInterval`, `WatcherDisplayMode`, overlay settings store/UI |
| Theme engine | `ThemeStore`, `ThemeModels`, `ThemesSectionView`, theme presets, `SmartColorProfile` presets, `GlowText`, `AnimatedGradient` |
| Updater / distribution | `UpdateService`, `UpdateStore`, `SignatureVerifier`, `BrewMigrationService`, `UpdateModalView`, `SparklePublicKey.txt`, `installer.applescript`, `docs/appcast.xml`, release + homebrew CI workflows, `UpdateModels` |
| Legacy migrations | `LegacyHelperCleanupService`, `SharedFileService` old-product-name + group-container migrations, `ElectronDecryptionService` keychain→file shim, `AppSection` legacy alias parsing, `DisplaySettingsStore` legacy-default migrations, `ThemeColors` legacy `SmartLevel` mapping, pre-`pacingWarning` theme decoder |
| Localization | `Shared/fr.lproj` (English only) |
| Popover | 2 of 3 layout variants; a single layout survives (section 3) |

Deleted tests go with their code (widget, overlay, theme, update, migration suites).

Kept fully working:

- Token resolution stack: `TokenProvider` with all 4 sources (`SecurityCLIReader`,
  `CredentialsFileReader`, `ClaudeConfigReader` + `ElectronDecryptionService`,
  direct Keychain fallback), `TokenFileMonitor`, silent-read rule.
- `APIClient` (both endpoints, SOCKS proxy support), `UsageRepository`.
- `UsageStore`, `SettingsStore`, pacing (`PacingCalculator`, bars, projections),
  notifications (`NotificationService`, thresholds), History (JSONL parsing via
  `SessionHistoryService`/`JSONLParser`, `HistoryStore`), Monitoring window,
  onboarding (simplified, section 3), vendor status banner, diagnostics.
- `ci.yml` build + test workflow; `build.sh`; the test suite for kept code.

`SharedFileService` shrinks to a plain offline-cache writer/reader (last-known
`CachedUsage` snapshot in `~/Library/Application Support/com.tokeneater.shared/`)
— no widget consumer remains, but the offline snapshot keeps launch instant.

`ProcessResolver` survives only for `detectClaudeCodeVersion()` (User-Agent
header); its session-scanning half goes with the overlay.

## 2. Design system

RaiDrive's conventions, codified as the single `DS` namespace (replacing the three
existing systems). The design is 100% system-semantic; no hex colors, automatic
dark/light.

- **Color by role, never by theme.** Risk drives color: ok = `.green`, warning =
  `.orange`, critical = `.red`, active/info = `.blue`. Text hierarchy `.primary` /
  `.secondary` / `.tertiary`. Tinted fills are the same semantic color at
  `opacity(0.10–0.15)`. Accent = system accent (empty AccentColor asset).
  `SmartColor`'s risk model survives but maps to these semantic colors.
- **Typography.** `.rounded` design reserved for the app name and hero numbers
  (`.font(.system(.headline, design: .rounded))` pattern). Everything else uses
  semantic Dynamic Type sizes: section headers `.subheadline.weight(.semibold)`,
  row text `.caption`, metadata `.caption2`. Every numeric value gets
  `.monospacedDigit()`.
- **Structure.** 14pt horizontal inset everywhere; vertical rhythm 10/8/6/4;
  `Divider()` separation instead of cards in the popover. Dashboard tiles are
  quiet `RoundedRectangle` with `.quinary`-level fills — no shadows, gradients, or
  glow anywhere.
- **Icons.** SF Symbols with `.symbolRenderingMode(.hierarchical)`; tinted-circle
  icon containers (32pt standard, 72pt hero); `symbolEffect(.pulse)` on the status
  glyph while a refresh is in flight.
- **Controls.** `.borderedProminent` for the one primary CTA per screen,
  `.borderless` for toolbars, `Button(role: .destructive)` for destructive rows,
  `.formStyle(.grouped)` + `LabeledContent` for settings.

## 3. Surfaces

- **Menu bar item.** `MenuBarRenderer` keeps its style options (icon only,
  percent, pinned metrics) with colors remapped to semantic risk colors. New
  pinnable metric: spend in dollars (`$142`). AppKit `NSStatusItem` hosting is
  unchanged.
- **Popover (single layout, ~340pt wide).** Vertical stack with dividers:
  1. Header: 32pt tinted status disc (pulsing hierarchical symbol) + app name in
     `.rounded` + plan badge + account email `.caption .tertiary`.
  2. Vendor outage banner (orange-tint inline pattern) when active.
  3. Metric rows — one per bucket present in the response (session 5h, weekly
     all-model, per-model weekly): label, thin native gauge, `%` monospaced,
     reset countdown in `.tertiary`.
  4. Spend section (when `extra_usage` present): plan-aware label, `$used / $limit`
     primary, thin bar + percent secondary.
  5. Footer toolbar: refresh · open dashboard · settings · quit — borderless,
     11pt symbols, 20pt hit targets.
- **Main window.** Native toolbar + sidebar navigation: Monitoring / History /
  Settings. Monitoring keeps the tile grid and hero pacing graph, flattened to
  semantic colors and `DS` tiles. History view keeps its charts, recolored.
  Settings sections rebuilt as grouped forms (`.formStyle(.grouped)`), replacing
  the custom "dark premium" chrome; remaining sections: General (refresh
  interval, menu bar style, pinned metrics, proxy), Pacing, Notifications,
  Diagnostics.
- **Onboarding.** Single hero screen replacing the card deck: 72pt tinted circle
  + light hierarchical glyph, `.rounded` title, one-line explanation, one
  `.borderedProminent` Connect button that calls `TokenProvider.bootstrap()`
  (the only interactive Keychain read). Error and retry states inline.

## 4. Spend & enterprise behavior

- **Model.** `ExtraUsage` is renamed conceptually to the spend metric (type name
  `SpendInfo`, decoded from `extra_usage`; JSON keys unchanged). Fields used:
  `is_enabled`, `used_credits`, `monthly_limit` (minor units), `currency`,
  `utilization`, `disabled_reason`.
- **Plan-aware label.** From `/api/oauth/profile`:
  `organization.organization_type == "claude_enterprise"` or `"claude_team"` →
  label **"Organization usage"**; otherwise → **"Extra usage"**. `PlanType`
  detection logic is unchanged; the label mapping is new.
- **Dollars primary.** `$used / $limit` rendered by `CurrencyFormatter` from minor
  units, honoring `currency`. Percent + bar are secondary. When `monthly_limit`
  is absent or 0: show `$used` with a "no cap" caption instead of a fake 0%.
  Menu bar pin shows `$used` compact (e.g. `$142`).
- **`billing_type` used.** Shown as a pill in the dashboard header next to
  rate-limit tier and org name.
- **Resilient decoding.** Sections render only if their bucket is present
  (existing behavior, preserved). The decoder additionally retains the raw
  response `Data` so unknown fields are inspectable rather than silently dropped.
- **Raw API viewer.** Settings → Diagnostics → "API Response": on demand, fetch
  both endpoints, pretty-print the JSON with the bearer token never included
  (it is a request header, not response content — viewer renders response bodies
  only), plus a Copy button. Purpose: at work, the owner opens the viewer once
  and we learn the exact enterprise response shape; any follow-up label/parsing
  adjustment becomes trivial.
- **No mode switch.** Personal Mac shows Pro/Max buckets; work Mac shows
  enterprise labeling + dollars. All differences derive from response + profile.

## 5. Project & CI changes

- `project.yml`: drop the widget target and its entitlements/plist wiring; keep
  `TokenEaterApp` and `TokenEaterTests`; remove the installer prebuild step.
  Regenerate with `xcodegen generate`.
- Workflows: keep only `ci.yml` (build + tests on PR/push). Delete `release.yml`
  and `test-build.yml` — both depend on signing/notarization secrets this fork
  does not have; local `build.sh` covers installs.
- Docs (`README`/`SETUP`/`AGENTS`): rewrite to match the reduced app after
  implementation stabilizes.

## 6. Staging & verification

Three stages, each ending with a green build + tests:

1. **Strip.** Delete cut-list items, fix compilation, prune project.yml and CI,
   delete orphaned tests. App runs with old look minus removed features.
2. **Reskin.** New `DS`, single popover, semantic colors, grouped settings,
   sidebar main window, hero onboarding.
3. **Spend.** `SpendInfo` + plan-aware labels + dollar displays + menu bar `$`
   pin + raw API viewer + `billing_type` pill + enterprise-shaped JSON fixtures.

Verification per repo rules:

- Full test suite after each stage (`xcodebuild ... -scheme TokenEaterTests test`).
- Release-configuration build with the Xcode 16.4 toolchain for any SwiftUI
  change; manual popover/menu-bar/dashboard walkthrough.
- Hard SwiftUI rules remain law: no `@Observable`, no `@StateObject` in the App
  struct, no bindings to computed properties, silent token reads.
- Enterprise behavior unit-tested with fixture JSONs (enterprise-shaped
  `extra_usage` + `claude_enterprise` profile); real-world confirmation via the
  raw API viewer on the work machine.

## Risks

- **Enterprise response shape is unvalidated.** We have never seen a real
  enterprise payload; the design assumes `extra_usage` carries the spend. The raw
  API viewer is the mitigation — worst case, labels/parsing adjust after one
  viewer screenshot.
- **Release-only SwiftUI bugs.** The reskin touches every view; the Release-build
  + manual-test discipline is the mitigation.
- **Deleting the widget target** touches project.yml, entitlements, CI, and docs
  simultaneously; stage 1 is kept mechanical (delete + compile) to contain this.
