# TokenEater Native Overhaul — Design Spec

Date: 2026-07-13
Status: approved by owner (fork intent, cut list, design language, spend design)

## Context

This repo is a personal fork of AThevon/TokenEater (v5.8.0), free to diverge from
upstream. The owner runs the app on two machines: a personal Mac (Claude Pro/Max
account) and a work Mac (Claude Enterprise account). Three problems drive this
overhaul:

1. **Enterprise mislabel.** Enterprise usage arrives via the API's `extra_usage`
   object, and the app labels it "Extra Credits" with a bare percentage. For an
   enterprise account that label is wrong, and the dollar figures the API provides
   (`used_credits`, `monthly_limit` in minor units + `currency`) are shown only on
   one dashboard tile — never in the menu bar, popover, or anywhere prominent.
2. **Visual identity sprawl.** Three design systems coexist (window `DS` tokens,
   theme-engine-colored popover/menu bar/overlay, separate widget tokens). The
   target look is the RaiDrive project's native macOS restraint.
3. **Unused surface area.** Widgets, the Agent Watchers overlay, the theme engine,
   the in-app updater/brew pipeline, legacy migrations, and French localization are
   unused by the owner.

## Goals

- One native macOS design language across every surface.
- Menu bar item as the primary surface: deeply configurable content, format,
  and display modes.
- Correct, plan-aware labeling of usage-based spend, with dollar amounts primary.
- Easy install on the work machine: downloadable DMG from GitHub Releases.
- Self-sufficient auth: sign in once per machine, app keeps itself authenticated
  — no Claude Code terminal required, no re-auth after reboot.
- Same binary adapts to personal (Pro/Max) and work (Enterprise) accounts with no
  mode switch — everything derives from the API response.
- A raw API response viewer so unknown account shapes can be inspected in-app.
- Substantially smaller codebase: delete unused features and legacy code.

## Non-goals

- No upstream compatibility; no PRs back to the original repo.
- No rename: app name, bundle IDs (`com.tokeneater.app`), and shared-cache paths
  stay, because renaming breaks Keychain ACL trust and signing. Cosmetic rename may
  happen later.
- No new metrics beyond what the two existing endpoints return.

## 1. The cut

Deleted outright (code, tests, project targets, docs references, CI steps):

| Area | Items |
|---|---|
| Widgets | `TokenEaterWidget/` target, widget entitlements, `NSExtension` plutil hack in workflows/docs, widget nuke instructions, `WidgetReloader` helper |
| Overlay / Agent Watchers | `OverlayWindowController`, `OverlayView`, `AgentWatchersSectionView`, `SessionMonitorService`, `SessionStore`, `OverlayHitTest`, `OverlayTriggerZone`, `WatcherStyle`, `WatcherVisibility`, `WatcherScanInterval`, `WatcherDisplayMode`, overlay settings store/UI |
| Theme engine | `ThemeStore`, `ThemeModels`, `ThemesSectionView`, theme presets, `SmartColorProfile` presets, `GlowText`, `AnimatedGradient` |
| Updater / distribution | `UpdateService`, `UpdateStore`, `SignatureVerifier`, `BrewMigrationService`, `UpdateModalView`, `SparklePublicKey.txt`, `installer.applescript`, `docs/appcast.xml`, release + homebrew CI workflows, `UpdateModels` |
| Legacy migrations | `LegacyHelperCleanupService`, `SharedFileService` old-product-name + group-container migrations, `ElectronDecryptionService` keychain→file shim, `AppSection` legacy alias parsing, `DisplaySettingsStore` legacy-default migrations, `ThemeColors` legacy `SmartLevel` mapping, pre-`pacingWarning` theme decoder |
| Localization | `Shared/fr.lproj` (English only) |
| Popover | 2 of 3 layout variants; a single layout survives (section 3) |

Deleted tests go with their code (widget, overlay, theme, update, migration suites).

Kept fully working:

- Token resolution stack: `TokenProvider` with all 4 sources (`SecurityCLIReader`,
  `CredentialsFileReader`, `ClaudeConfigReader` + `ElectronDecryptionService`,
  direct Keychain fallback), `TokenFileMonitor`, silent-read rule.
- `APIClient` (both endpoints, SOCKS proxy support), `UsageRepository`.
- `UsageStore`, `SettingsStore`, pacing (`PacingCalculator`, bars, projections),
  notifications (`NotificationService`, thresholds), History (JSONL parsing via
  `SessionHistoryService`/`JSONLParser`, `HistoryStore`), Monitoring window,
  onboarding (simplified, section 3), vendor status banner, diagnostics.
- `ci.yml` build + test workflow; `build.sh`; the test suite for kept code.

`SharedFileService` shrinks to a plain offline-cache writer/reader (last-known
`CachedUsage` snapshot in `~/Library/Application Support/com.tokeneater.shared/`)
— no widget consumer remains, but the offline snapshot keeps launch instant.

`ProcessResolver` survives only for `detectClaudeCodeVersion()` (User-Agent
header); its session-scanning half goes with the overlay.

## 2. Design system

> **REVISED 2026-07-13 (owner design review):** the original "system colors only,
> no hex" rule is superseded. The owner wants a specific **pastel palette** and a
> **solid, opaque, dark** look (RaiDrive-like, not translucent). Hex is now allowed
> **only** in the one `DS` palette definition; every view still references `DS`
> tokens / `RiskZone` / `PacingZone`, never raw hex. The app is **dark-first**
> (fixed dark panels); only the **menu bar** adapts to the wallpaper.

### Pastel palette (single source of truth in `DS`)

| Token | Pastel (dark bg) | Deepened (light bg, menu-bar only) |
|---|---|---|
| risk OK (green) | `#86D6A0` | `#4FAE74` |
| risk warning (amber) | `#F2C288` | `#D99A4E` |
| risk critical (coral) | `#EF9A8D` | `#D46A58` |
| info / on-track (blue) | `#93B4EE` | `#5B82D6` |

Surfaces: **app windows** are opaque solid dark (no wash-out) — window base
`#161719`, card/elevated `#1A1B1E`, hairline `#2C2E33`, gauge track `#26282D`.
The **popover** is the exception: it keeps the **native macOS translucent window
material** (RaiDrive-style vibrancy), not a solid fill — its cards/tracks still
use the tokens above for contrast over the material. No glow anywhere. Text
keeps SwiftUI `.primary` / `.secondary` / `.tertiary` (resolve white-ish on the
dark surfaces). `RiskZone.color`/`.nsColor` and `PacingZone.semanticColor` return
these pastels (chill→green, onTrack→blue, warning→amber, hot→coral).

### Menu bar rendering — option B (adaptive text + colored dot)

The status-item text must stay legible over any wallpaper. Rendering:
- **Text** uses the menu bar's effective appearance: near-white (`#F4F4F6`) on a
  dark menu bar, near-black (`#1C1C1E`) on a light one. `MenuBarRenderer.RenderData`
  gains `menuBarIsDark: Bool`; `StatusBarController` reads
  `statusItem.button.effectiveAppearance` and re-renders on appearance change.
- **Risk color** rides a small filled dot before each metric (pastel on a dark
  bar, the deepened variant on a light bar). `colorMode = .risk` shows dots;
  `colorMode = .monochrome` shows none (adaptive text only).

Everything below still holds (SF Symbols hierarchical, `.monospacedDigit()` on all
numerics, 14pt inset, `Divider()` separation in the popover, `RoundedRectangle`
cards) — recolored to the palette above.

### Typography — minimal & modern (owner design review)

**Drop `.rounded` entirely** (it reads playful, not minimal). Use the **default
system font (SF Pro)** everywhere, including the app name and hero numbers.
Restrained weights: hero/big numbers `.medium` (never `.bold`/`.heavy`/`.black`),
section labels `.regular`/`.medium`, secondary `.regular`. `.monospacedDigit()`
stays on every numeric. Clean and quiet — no chunky or decorative type.

### Motion — minimal & restrained (owner design review)

The current app reads as "too futuristic." The pastel look calls for quiet,
modern motion. **Remove:** the blur-burst space transition, `matchedGeometry`
pill glides, card-flip animations, glow/pulse-heavy effects, animated gradients,
hover scale-ups, and any bouncy/overshooting springs. **Use instead:** simple
crossfades or no transition on view switches; gentle default easing
(`.easeInOut`, short ~0.15–0.2s) for state changes; SF Symbol effects only where
they carry meaning (e.g. the refresh glyph pulse while loading). No motion for
motion's sake. When in doubt, prefer the platform default or nothing. This binds
every remaining UI task (sidebar nav, monitoring/history tiles, settings,
onboarding).

- **Color by role, never by theme.** Risk drives color: ok = `.green`, warning =
  `.orange`, critical = `.red`, active/info = `.blue`. Text hierarchy `.primary` /
  `.secondary` / `.tertiary`. Tinted fills are the same semantic color at
  `opacity(0.10–0.15)`. Accent = system accent (empty AccentColor asset).
  `SmartColor`'s risk model survives but maps to these semantic colors.
- **Typography.** `.rounded` design reserved for the app name and hero numbers
  (`.font(.system(.headline, design: .rounded))` pattern). Everything else uses
  semantic Dynamic Type sizes: section headers `.subheadline.weight(.semibold)`,
  row text `.caption`, metadata `.caption2`. Every numeric value gets
  `.monospacedDigit()`.
- **Structure.** 14pt horizontal inset everywhere; vertical rhythm 10/8/6/4;
  `Divider()` separation instead of cards in the popover. Dashboard tiles are
  quiet `RoundedRectangle` with `.quinary`-level fills — no shadows, gradients, or
  glow anywhere.
- **Icons.** SF Symbols with `.symbolRenderingMode(.hierarchical)`; tinted-circle
  icon containers (32pt standard, 72pt hero); `symbolEffect(.pulse)` on the status
  glyph while a refresh is in flight.
- **Controls.** `.borderedProminent` for the one primary CTA per screen,
  `.borderless` for toolbars, `Button(role: .destructive)` for destructive rows,
  `.formStyle(.grouped)` + `LabeledContent` for settings.

## 3. Surfaces

- **Menu bar item — the primary surface.** The owner lives in the menu bar, so
  it gets the deepest configurability. `MenuBarRenderer` stays a pure, unit-
  tested helper; AppKit `NSStatusItem` hosting is unchanged. Everything below is
  user-configurable from a new Settings → Menu Bar section with a live preview:
  - **Pinned metrics.** Any subset of available metrics (session 5h, weekly,
    per-model weeklies, spend), user-ordered, shown side by side with a
    configurable separator (`·` default).
  - **Per-metric format.** Prefix style (SF Symbol, short label like `5h`/`W`,
    or none) and value style (percent, dollars for spend, remaining instead of
    used) per pinned metric.
  - **Display modes.** All-pinned row · highest-risk-only (single metric, the
    one closest to its limit) · rotate through pinned metrics every N seconds.
  - **Reset countdown.** Optional inline countdown next to a metric
    (`42% · 2h13m`), format configurable (compact / clock time).
  - **Color.** Monochrome template (native menu bar look) or semantic risk
    coloring (green/orange/red); applies to text, icon, or both.
  - **Icon.** Show/hide the app glyph; glyph tint follows overall risk;
    `symbolEffect(.pulse)` during refresh.
  - All numbers `.monospacedDigit()` to prevent menu bar width jitter; fixed-
    width rendering option to stop neighbor icons shifting.
- **Popover (single layout, ~340pt wide).** One layout (the old 3-variant +
  drag-editor system is gone). **No arrow** (owner review): presented as a
  borderless panel anchored under the status item (RaiDrive-style), backed by an
  `NSVisualEffectView` for native translucency — not an `NSPopover` with its
  up-arrow. **Configurable (owner review, reversing the earlier
  zero-config call):** a `PopoverConfig` — independent of the menu bar's
  `MenuBarConfig` — lets the user choose/reorder which metric rows appear and
  toggle sections (pacing chips, spend, timestamp), edited in a Settings → Popover
  section with a live preview. A metric renders only if visible in the config AND
  present in the API response. Vertical stack with dividers:
  1. Header: 32pt tinted status disc (pulsing hierarchical symbol) + app name in
     default SF Pro + plan badge + account email `.caption .tertiary`.
  2. Vendor outage banner (orange-tint inline pattern) when active.
  3. Metric rows — one per bucket present in the response (session 5h, weekly
     all-model, per-model weekly): label, thin native gauge, `%` monospaced,
     reset countdown in `.tertiary`.
  4. Spend section (when `extra_usage` present): plan-aware label, `$used / $limit`
     primary, thin bar + percent secondary.
  5. Footer toolbar: refresh · open dashboard · settings · quit — borderless,
     11pt symbols, 20pt hit targets.
- **Main window.** Native toolbar + sidebar navigation: Monitoring / History /
  Settings. Monitoring keeps the tile grid and hero pacing graph, flattened to
  semantic colors and `DS` tiles. History view keeps its charts, recolored.
  Settings sections rebuilt as grouped forms (`.formStyle(.grouped)`), replacing
  the custom "dark premium" chrome; remaining sections: General (refresh
  interval, menu bar style, pinned metrics, proxy), Pacing, Notifications,
  Diagnostics.
- **Onboarding.** Single hero screen replacing the card deck: 72pt tinted circle
  + light hierarchical glyph, `.rounded` title, one-line explanation, one
  `.borderedProminent` Connect button that calls `TokenProvider.bootstrap()`
  (the only interactive Keychain read). Error and retry states inline.

## 4. Spend & enterprise behavior

- **Model.** `ExtraUsage` is renamed conceptually to the spend metric (type name
  `SpendInfo`, decoded from `extra_usage`; JSON keys unchanged). Fields used:
  `is_enabled`, `used_credits`, `monthly_limit` (minor units), `currency`,
  `utilization`, `disabled_reason`.
- **Plan-aware label.** From `/api/oauth/profile`:
  `organization.organization_type == "claude_enterprise"` or `"claude_team"` →
  label **"Organization usage"**; otherwise → **"Extra usage"**. `PlanType`
  detection logic is unchanged; the label mapping is new.
- **Dollars primary.** `$used / $limit` rendered by `CurrencyFormatter` from minor
  units, honoring `currency`. Percent + bar are secondary. When `monthly_limit`
  is absent or 0: show `$used` with a "no cap" caption instead of a fake 0%.
  Menu bar pin shows `$used` compact (e.g. `$142`).
- **`billing_type` used.** Shown as a pill in the dashboard header next to
  rate-limit tier and org name.
- **Resilient decoding.** Sections render only if their bucket is present
  (existing behavior, preserved). The decoder additionally retains the raw
  response `Data` so unknown fields are inspectable rather than silently dropped.
- **Raw API viewer.** Settings → Diagnostics → "API Response": on demand, fetch
  both endpoints, pretty-print the JSON with the bearer token never included
  (it is a request header, not response content — viewer renders response bodies
  only), plus a Copy button. Purpose: at work, the owner opens the viewer once
  and we learn the exact enterprise response shape; any follow-up label/parsing
  adjustment becomes trivial.
- **No mode switch.** Personal Mac shows Pro/Max buckets; work Mac shows
  enterprise labeling + dollars. All differences derive from response + profile.

## 5. Self-sufficient authentication

Today the app only borrows Claude Code's OAuth token (Keychain item
`Claude Code-credentials` via the `security` CLI, or credential files) and has
no refresh capability of its own. Two failure modes follow:

- The borrowed access token expires unless Claude Code itself is running to
  refresh it — hence "keep a terminal open".
- Local ad-hoc builds change code-signing identity, so the Keychain ACL
  "Always Allow" doesn't stick and every reboot/rebuild re-prompts.

Fix:

- **First-class OAuth login (primary).** New `OAuthService` implementing the
  same authorization-code + PKCE flow Claude Code uses (public client id,
  `claude.ai` authorize page, token exchange endpoint). Login: browser opens →
  user authorizes → local loopback callback (127.0.0.1, random port; manual
  code-paste fallback) → access + refresh tokens stored in an **app-owned**
  Keychain item (service `com.tokeneater.oauth`). Because the app creates the
  item, reads are ACL-prompt-free regardless of signing identity.
- **Autonomous refresh.** `TokenProvider` refreshes proactively before
  `expiresAt` and reactively on 401 (refresh → retry once). No dependency on
  Claude Code running; survives reboots for the refresh token's lifetime.
- **Borrowed token demoted to fallback.** The existing Claude Code readers
  remain as a secondary "use Claude Code's session" connect option (useful
  first-run shortcut), clearly labeled, with its known limitations.
- **Onboarding:** primary button "Sign in with Claude" (runs OAuthService),
  secondary "Use Claude Code's token" (runs today's bootstrap).
- **Sign out:** deletes the app-owned Keychain item and clears in-memory cache.
- Tokens live only in the Keychain and memory — never on disk; `shared.json`
  continues to hold usage numbers only.
- **Risk:** the OAuth client id/endpoints are unpublished internals and could
  change; the borrowed-token fallback stays as the safety net. Validated by a
  real login during implementation.

## 6. Project & CI changes

- `project.yml`: drop the widget target and its entitlements/plist wiring; keep
  `TokenEaterApp` and `TokenEaterTests`; remove the installer prebuild step.
  Regenerate with `xcodegen generate`.
- Workflows: keep `ci.yml` (build + tests on PR/push). Replace `release.yml`
  with a trimmed release workflow: on `v*` tag (or manual dispatch), build
  Release, ad-hoc sign, package a DMG, attach it to a GitHub Release. No
  notarization (owner has no paid Apple Developer account); Sparkle/appcast/
  homebrew publishing deleted. Delete `test-build.yml`.
- **Install story (work machine).** Download DMG from the fork's GitHub
  Releases → drag to /Applications → first launch via right-click → Open (or
  System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway) because the build is not
  notarized. Documented as a short "Install" section in the README. Known risk:
  a strict MDM policy that fully blocks unidentified developers would require
  building from source on the work machine instead; treated as a fallback, not
  the primary path.
- Docs (`README`/`SETUP`/`AGENTS`): rewrite to match the reduced app after
  implementation stabilizes.

## 7. Staging & verification

Four stages, each ending with a green build + tests:

1. **Strip.** Delete cut-list items, fix compilation, prune project.yml and CI,
   delete orphaned tests. App runs with old look minus removed features.
2. **Reskin.** New `DS`, single popover, semantic colors, grouped settings,
   sidebar main window, hero onboarding, menu bar configurability (pinned
   metrics, formats, display modes, live preview).
3. **Auth.** `OAuthService` + autonomous refresh + onboarding sign-in +
   sign-out; borrowed-token readers demoted to fallback.
4. **Spend + ship.** `SpendInfo` + plan-aware labels + dollar displays + menu
   bar `$` pin + raw API viewer + `billing_type` pill + enterprise-shaped JSON
   fixtures; trimmed DMG release workflow + README install section.

Verification per repo rules:

- Full test suite after each stage (`xcodebuild ... -scheme TokenEaterTests test`).
- Release-configuration build with the Xcode 16.4 toolchain for any SwiftUI
  change; manual popover/menu-bar/dashboard walkthrough.
- Hard SwiftUI rules remain law: no `@Observable`, no `@StateObject` in the App
  struct, no bindings to computed properties, silent token reads.
- Enterprise behavior unit-tested with fixture JSONs (enterprise-shaped
  `extra_usage` + `claude_enterprise` profile); real-world confirmation via the
  raw API viewer on the work machine.

## Risks

- **Enterprise response shape is unvalidated.** We have never seen a real
  enterprise payload; the design assumes `extra_usage` carries the spend. The raw
  API viewer is the mitigation — worst case, labels/parsing adjust after one
  viewer screenshot.
- **Release-only SwiftUI bugs.** The reskin touches every view; the Release-build
  + manual-test discipline is the mitigation.
- **Deleting the widget target** touches project.yml, entitlements, CI, and docs
  simultaneously; stage 1 is kept mechanical (delete + compile) to contain this.
